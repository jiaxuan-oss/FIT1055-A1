Assignment Instructions
For this assignment, you are required to investigate the ethical issues of the use of artificial intelligence methods in technology products and produce a professionally written report. To complete this assignment, you must:
Select ONE topic of investigation from the below-provided topics.
ChatGpt. For this topic, please click on the AIAAAC repository to view ChatGPT Chatbot  reported issues.
Influencing,Disinformation,Fakes. For this topic, please click on the Awful AI repository to view a list of reported ethical issues under Influencing/Disinformation/Fakes. Choose ONE topic from the list (e.g. Anyvision Facial Recognition). 
Use the intelligent research cycle process (provided in Chapter 4 of Ebook) to investigate the plausible cause of the ethical issue in your chosen topic, with the goal of your research being to clearly define the problem.
Please refer to your  Week 4 tutorial worksheet as an example in applying the process. Following the research cycle process, you should be doing the following:
Use the Monash library database and Web search to search for your independent sources. It must have a minimum of five (5) independent sources for your chosen topic. You are allowed to have more than 5 but they must include:
Two (2) primary academic sources – e.g. a journal article or book chapter  -
Two (2) secondary news media sources – e.g. online newspapers or journals
One (1) tertiary source.
Read the sources you have collected.
Perform analysis on the sources you have collected (refer to Chapter Four of Ebook for definition and explanation how to perform analysis).
Write a report to share the output of your investigation. The report must have the following sections: 
Title (max 20 words) 
Set a specific title that reflects the major findings of your investigation.
Introduction to the topic (~500 words)
Brief background of the topic.
The main topic of investigation.
Significance of the topic of investigation with supporting evidences of sources (i.e. Why is the topic important for a computing professional?).
Literature review of the selected sources (~900 words)
Definition of the techniques and/or concepts used for the computing application. 
Techniques refer to computing techniques such as recommendation algorithms, machine learning techniques, image processing techniques, etc. 
Concepts refers to an idea or an invention, for example an autonomous vehicle is an idea about making a car driving on its own, or a moral machine is an idea to make a machine that has moral conduct..  
Analysis of how the techniques and/or concepts used have most likely led to the significance of the topic being investigated (i.e., ethical issues) using your independent sources.
A clear problem statement that defines what is the actual problem, why has it become an ethical problem, and how did it become so. The problem statement should be provided with clear reasoning, evidence and justifications supported by your sources. (~650 words)
Conclusion
Summary of the topic of investigation and its significance.
List of citations of the sources you selected (references). References are not included in the word count.
Use APA citation style.
